CSS_Bootstrap Homework

This website was primarily constructed with Bootstrap's responsive grid system and elements.

The website has a consistent Nav Bar and footer on each of its pages.

The website consists of three main pages located in the Nav Bar.

    About- This section gives a quick bio of myself, as well as some of my interests/hobbies.
    Portfolio- Following this link in the Nav Bar takes you to a page laid out with five cards with attached links. The first card takes you to my Code Refactor assignment, while the other four take you to my various social media pages.
    Contact- This section consists of a form taken from Bootstrap. It has Name, Email, and Message input boxes for the user to fill out at their convenience.

The website also displays some of my own CSS elements, but a lot of the styling was done with direct Bootstrap commands and classes.

I hope you enjoy the website!
